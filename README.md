# Element for Ferdi / Franz
This is a Ferdi / Franz recipe/plugin for Element, which was formerly known as Riot and Vector and is a web client for [matrix].

## Installation
1. Open the Franz Plugins (`dev`elopment) folder on your machine, if the directory does not exist, create it:
  * Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Ferdi/recipes/dev/`
    * `mkdir ~/Library/Application Support/Ferdi/recipes/dev/`
  * Linux: `~/.config/Ferdi/recipes/dev/`
    * `mkdir ~/.config/Ferdi/recipes/dev/
  * Windows: `%appdata%/Ferdi/recipes/dev/`
    
2. [Download](https://github.com/gregoryhammond/ferdi-riot/blob/master/ferdi-riot.zip) or clone this repo (you don't need the entire repo along with the zip file included) into the `dev` directory – as sub-directory `ferdi-riot` (e.g.).
3. Reload Ferdi.
4. Add New Service (Ctrl + N)
5. Click on Custom Services
6. Click on Element (under Community 3rd Party Recipes).
7. Go to the Element service and login.

Huge thanks to [Sylvain Cecchetto for the original recipe / plugin for this](https://github.com/sy6sy2/recipe-riot), [Simon Lüke](https://github.com/semaphor/recipe-element) for the fork that I found on Google.

This has been customized to fit [Ferdi](https://getferdi.com/) and [midov.pl Element server](https://element.midov.pl), but you can modify it to fit your own needs.
